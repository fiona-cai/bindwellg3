Question 1 — Keyword-Based --------------------------
Question:
Under Part 6.4.1.1, what information must an Operator provide when making the 24-hour adverse incident notification to EPA?
Type: Keyword
Key terms triggered: “Part 6.4.1.1”, “24-hour adverse incident notification”, “information must include”

Why this is a good test:
- Forces precise retrieval of a clearly enumerated list (items a–i).
- Tests whether the agent can stay within the correct subsection and not mix in 30-day reporting or spill reporting requirements.

Failure modes it catches:
- Hallucinating requirements not listed
- Mixing in Part 6.4.2 (30-day report) or FIFRA reporting
- Over-summarizing instead of listing required elements

Question 2 — Semantic (Paraphrase) --------------------

Question:
When are Operators required to revise Pest Management Measures, even if no spill has occurred?
Type: Semantic
Underlying source: Part 6.1(b)–(e)

Why this is a good test:
- Does not use the phrase “Situations Requiring Revision of Pest Management Measures.”
- Requires the model to semantically understand that monitoring failures, inspections, inadequacy, and adverse incidents all trigger revisions.

Failure modes it catches:
- Only mentioning spills (6.1(a))
- Missing inspection- or monitoring-based triggers
- Treating corrective action as optional instead of mandatory

Question 3 — Many-Meanings / Segmentation --------------------------

Question:
If a pesticide spill occurs but does not result in an adverse incident, what reporting or documentation obligations apply, and under which parts of the permit?
Type: Many-meanings (segmentation required)
Ambiguous term: “spill”

Why this is a good test:
- “Spill” appears in multiple regulatory contexts:
- Part 6.5.1 (NRC notification)
- Part 6.5.2 (30-day documentation)
- Part 6.4 (only if it results in an adverse incident)
- The model must separate spill reporting from adverse incident reporting.

Failure modes it catches:
- Automatically invoking 24-hour adverse incident reporting
- Ignoring NRC notification thresholds
- Failing to mention 30-day documentation retention

Question 4 — Many-Meanings + Role-Based Reasoning ------------------
Question:
How do recordkeeping and annual reporting obligations differ between a small-entity Decision-maker and a large-entity Decision-maker who both submit an NOI?
- Type: Many-meanings (role & classification segmentation)
Ambiguous concept: “Decision-maker reporting requirements”

Why this is a good test:
- Requires segmentation across:
- Entity size (small vs large)
- Obligation type (recordkeeping vs annual reporting)
- Permit sections (Parts 7.3, 7.4, 7.6, 7.7)
- Mimics real consultant questions like “What applies to my client?”

Failure modes it catches:
-Treating all Decision-makers the same
-Missing PDMP or annual report obligations for large entities
- Confusing NOI submission with annual reporting triggers


Question 5 — Many-Meanings / Routing & Submission Logic --------------

Question:
If EPA’s NPDES eReporting Tool (NeT) is unavailable, where must a Decision-maker submit an NOI or annual report, and how does this differ from where adverse incident reports are sent?
Type: Many-meanings (submission routing & document type segmentation)

Why this is a good test:
- The question intentionally bundles multiple document types:-
- NOI / NOT / annual reports
- Adverse incident reports
- The agent must correctly segment:
- EPA Headquarters submission (Part 8.1)
- EPA Regional Office + state/tribal agency submission (Part 6.4 via Part 8.2)

Failure modes it catches:
-Sending everything to EPA Headquarters
- Confusing NeT unavailability with adverse incident routing
- Missing the requirement to notify state or tribal pesticide lead agencies

Question 6 — Semantic + Geographic Reasoning -------------

Question:
Where should an Operator located in California send written correspondence related to discharges under this permit that is not an NOI, NOT, annual report, or adverse incident report?
Type: Semantic (paraphrased + geographic lookup)

Why this is a good test:
- Does not quote “Part 8.2” or “EPA Regional Addresses” directly.
- Requires the model to:
- Recognize this is “all other written correspondence”
- Identify the correct EPA Region
- Retrieve the correct regional mailing address (Region 9 – San Francisco)

Failure modes it catches:
- Defaulting to EPA Headquarters incorrectly
- Choosing the wrong EPA Region
- Ignoring the distinction between report types
[also cuz Clients frequently ask “Which office do we send this to?” and the answer depends on both document type and location.]

Question 7 - Evaluation Question ------------------

Question:
An operator plans a pesticide application in New Mexico that will discharge to a Tier 3 Outstanding Natural Resource Water (ONRW) for ecosystem restoration purposes. 
Under the PGP, is the operator eligible for coverage, and what materials must be submitted, to whom, and for what purpose before the discharge occurs?
Question Type:- Many-meanings / Semantic (regulatory eligibility + submission + purpose)
