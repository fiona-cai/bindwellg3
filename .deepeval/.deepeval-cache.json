If \\nyou certify under Criterion F and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may \\nassume your discharge is authorized. For certifications pursuant to Criterion G, \\nindicate whether the discharge is likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse \\neffects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of \\nConcern and, if so, any feasible measures to avoid or eliminate such adverse effects. \\nIf you are certifying under Criterion G (which allows you to discharge 15 or 30 days \\nbefore you even submit your NOI after notification and coordination with the FWS and \\nNMFS), your NOI should describe both the pest emergency activities you plan to do \\nafter you submit your NOI as well as the activities you performed in that 15 or 30 day \\nperiod before you had to submit the NOI. See Part 1.1.2.4 and Appendix I of the PGP \\nfor more information regarding Endangered and Threatened Species and Critical \\nHabitat Protection.  \\n4. If your discharge is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, prior to \\nany discharge to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities under \\nCriterion G, Decision-makers must notify and coordinate with FWS and NMFS to be \\neligible for coverage. Notification shall occur and coordination shall begin as soon as \\npossible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a \\nDeclared Pest Emergency Situation. The notification must be in the form of an email \\nthat identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and include a \\ndescription of the action, the pest management area and Project Action Area map, and \\na list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern \\nidentified in the Project Action Area or the list from EPA\\u2019s geospatial mapping tool \\nshowing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of \\nConcern occur in the Project Action Area. \\n5. EPA may authorize certain discharges in less than 30 days, but no fewer than 10 \\ndays, for any discharges authorized under Criterion C, D, or E (for which FWS and/or \\nNMFS has already evaluated the effects of these discharges). If you certify under one \\nof these criteria and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume your \\ndischarge is authorized.    \\nSection E.

However, if EPA \\nnotifies the Operator to apply for an NPDES individual permit or alternative general \\npermit, coverage under this permit terminates automatically. Dischargers \\nautomatically covered under this permit as identified in Part 1.2.3 of the permit are \\nlikewise automatically terminated upon permanent cessation of discharge consistent \\nwith any of the criteria identified in Part 1.2.5.3 of the permit. As required in the \\npermit, only certain Operators who are also Decision-makers must submit NOIs. \\nNote: NOIs submitted under the 2021 PGP are automatically terminated at 11:59 \\np.m. on October 30, 2026. Decision-maker who are required to submit an NOI must \\nsubmit a new NOI to obtain coverage under the 2026 PGP. \\nIf you have questions about whether you need to file an NOT or questions about \\ncompleting the form, see https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting or contact \\nthe NPDES eReporting help desk at (877) 227-8965 or Email at \\nNPDESeReporting@epa.gov. \\nWhen to File the NOT? \\nOperators must file the NOT form within 30 days after one or more of the conditions \\nin Part 1.2.5.2 of the permit have been met. \\nApproval to Use Paper NOT Form: Note that you are not authorized to use this \\npaper NOT form unless the EPA Regional Office has approved its use.

Verify that waters within the pest management area are either not impaired by \\nsubstances which are either active ingredients in the pesticide planned for use or \\ndegradates of such active ingredients, OR that evidence shows that the target \\nwaters in question are no longer impaired. See Part 1.1.2.1 of the permit for more \\ninformation on discharges to Water Quality Impaired Waters. Indicate if permit \\ncoverage is being requested to discharge to waters impaired for pesticide \\ngenerally, group of pesticides, or active ingredients or degradate of such an active \\ningredient. \\nSection D. Endangered Species Protection. Complete Section D for each pest \\nmanagement area for which coverage under EPA\\u2019s PGP is desired. \\nIdentify the pest management areas, corresponding to those in Part C. \\n1. Coverage under the permit is available only for discharges to waters of the United \\nStates and discharge-related activities that are not likely to result in any short- or long-\\nterm adverse effects to any species that are federally-listed as endangered or \\nthreatened (\\u201clisted\\u201d) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and not likely to result \\nin any short- or long-term adverse modification or destruction of habitat that is \\nfederally-designated as critical under the ESA (\\u201ccritical habitat\\u201d) except as provided in \\nCriterion C, D, and for at least 60 days, G, below. For FWS Listed Resources of \\nConcern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A of the PGP, \\nthere are specific criteria for determining eligibility. To demonstrate eligibility, you must \\nmeet one or more of the six eligibility criteria (A-G) for the entire term of coverage \\nunder the permit and provide supporting documentation. A step-by-step guide with a \\nworksheet for determining eligibility is provided in Appendix I of the PGP. If you \\nreceived a waiver to file a paper NOI, you must submit a copy of the map and list of all \\nFWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated \\nthrough the EPA\\u2019s geospatial mapping tool for your Project Action Area and your \\nworksheet (Appendix I) with your paper NOI. \\n2. You must provide a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, including \\nthe pest management area, using the tools at \\nhttps://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-\\npermitting-ESA-procedures. E valuation of the pest management area must include a \\nlist showing any overlap with federally-listed species and/or designated critical habitats \\ngenerated within 90 days of seeking permit coverage.\\n\\nEPA FORM 6100-22 (Revised December 10, 2024)                       Page 8 of 8 \\n3. If you checked Criterion F or Criterion G, you are required to provide the target \\npest(s), pesticide product(s) to be discharged and method of application, planned \\nquantity and rate of discharge(s) for each application method, number of planned \\ndischarges, approximate date(s) of planned discharge(s), and the rational supporting \\nyour determination that you meet the criterion for which the Decision-maker is \\nsubmitting this NOI and documentation demonstrating the finding of \\u201cnot likely to result \\nin any short- or long-term adverse effects\\u201d for each FWS Listed Resources of Concern \\nand/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in your Project Action Area. If \\nyou certify under Criterion F and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may \\nassume your discharge is authorized. For certifications pursuant to Criterion G, \\nindicate whether the discharge is likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse \\neffects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of \\nConcern and, if so, any feasible measures to avoid or eliminate such adverse effects. \\nIf you are certifying under Criterion G (which allows you to discharge 15 or 30 days \\nbefore you even submit your NOI after notification and coordination with the FWS and \\nNMFS), your NOI should describe both the pest emergency activities you plan to do \\nafter you submit your NOI as well as the activities you performed in that 15 or 30 day \\nperiod before you had to submit the NOI. See Part 1.1.2.4 and Appendix I of the PGP \\nfor more information regarding Endangered and Threatened Species and Critical \\nHabitat Protection.  \\n4. If your discharge is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, prior to \\nany discharge to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities under \\nCriterion G, Decision-makers must notify and coordinate with FWS and NMFS to be \\neligible for coverage. Notification shall occur and coordination shall begin as soon as \\npossible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a \\nDeclared Pest Emergency Situation. The notification must be in the form of an email \\nthat identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and include a \\ndescription of the action, the pest management area and Project Action Area map, and \\na list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern \\nidentified in the Project Action Area or the list from EPA\\u2019s geospatial mapping tool \\nshowing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of \\nConcern occur in the Project Action Area. \\n5. EPA may authorize certain discharges in less than 30 days, but no fewer than 10 \\ndays, for any discharges authorized under Criterion C, D, or E (for which FWS and/or \\nNMFS has already evaluated the effects of these discharges). If you certify under one \\nof these criteria and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume your \\ndischarge is authorized.    \\nSection E. Attachments \\nIndicate attachments you are submitting with your NOI in this section. If you are \\nattaching a document that is not listed, indicate other and provide a description of the \\ndocument. \\nSection F. Certification \\nEnter the certifier\\u2019s printed name and title.

In the event that EPA has placed a hold on your NOI, EPA will notify you as \\nto whether your discharges are authorized or whether an NPDES individual permit will be \\nrequired. If you do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume that your discharge is \\nauthorized without further conditions. Authorization will remain in effect unless and until \\nnotified by EPA that activities identified in the NOI will be reevaluated. If the discharges are in \\nresponse to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, you must follow the notification and \\ncoordination procedures with the Services prior to discharges, followed by NOI submittal, under \\nCriterion G.

If \\nyou certify under Criterion F and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may \\nassume your discharge is authorized. For certifications pursuant to Criterion G, \\nindicate whether the discharge is likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse \\neffects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of \\nConcern and, if so, any feasible measures to avoid or eliminate such adverse effects. \\nIf you are certifying under Criterion G (which allows you to discharge 15 or 30 days \\nbefore you even submit your NOI after notification and coordination with the FWS and \\nNMFS), your NOI should describe both the pest emergency activities you plan to do \\nafter you submit your NOI as well as the activities you performed in that 15 or 30 day \\nperiod before you had to submit the NOI. See Part 1.1.2.4 and Appendix I of the PGP \\nfor more information regarding Endangered and Threatened Species and Critical \\nHabitat Protection.  \\n4. If your discharge is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, prior to \\nany discharge to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities under \\nCriterion G, Decision-makers must notify and coordinate with FWS and NMFS to be \\neligible for coverage. Notification shall occur and coordination shall begin as soon as \\npossible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a \\nDeclared Pest Emergency Situation. The notification must be in the form of an email \\nthat identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and include a \\ndescription of the action, the pest management area and Project Action Area map, and \\na list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern \\nidentified in the Project Action Area or the list from EPA\\u2019s geospatial mapping tool \\nshowing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of \\nConcern occur in the Project Action Area. \\n5. EPA may authorize certain discharges in less than 30 days, but no fewer than 10 \\ndays, for any discharges authorized under Criterion C, D, or E (for which FWS and/or \\nNMFS has already evaluated the effects of these discharges). If you certify under one \\nof these criteria and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume your \\ndischarge is authorized.    \\nSection E.
